## STEP-00: Initialization
### Pre-Execution
**Objective**: Read all issue implementation plans and understand the codebase structure before implementing

**Beliefs**:
- The speak project is in `/Users/jay/Documents/speak/`
- Implementation plans are detailed and complete in `/Users/jay/Documents/speak/v1/issues/`
- Issues should be implemented in priority order: #001, #003, #004, #002, then #005-#010

**Assumptions**:
- The codebase structure matches what's described in the implementation plans
- Code snippets in the plans are accurate to the current codebase

**Questions**:
1. What is the current directory structure of the speak project?
2. What files exist in src/?
3. Do the paths referenced in implementation plans exist?

### Execution
Reading codebase structure to verify assumptions before implementing...
